\textbf{Funding Request for Student Krylov Day 2015}
\bigskip
\bigskip

Dear Prof. Van Horssen, \hfill \today

\bigskip
We have recently founded a \textit{SIAM Student Chapter} at our university. Our Student Chapter is the first division of SIAM in The Netherlands, and it is meant to bring together MSc and PhD students, postdocs and professors from all mathematically-oriented departments. The Chapter organizes seminars, lectures (both on research and on software tools), company visits and social events, which are financially supported by SIAM. Our faculty advisors are Martin van Gijzen and Kees Vuik and we currently have about 50 student members from different departments at TU Delft.

\bigskip
At this moment, we are organizing a \textbf{one-day workshop on Krylov methods} which will be held on February 2, 2015 at TU Delft. Therefore, we invited PhD students from different European countries who will present their recent work on Krylov methods. During the workshop, we would like to organize a joint lunch and offer refreshments (see cost estimate below). All information about our workshop can be found online:

\end{center}

% \bigskip
% Many succesfull Student Chapters also obtain yearly funding from their own university. In this way, the Student Chapters can reach out to more different departments and invite more people to their talks. Is it possible that our Chapter also obtains some regular funding from the TU Delft?

% \bigskip
% If you have any further enquiries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

\bigskip
\noindent For the realization of this workshop, we kindly ask DIAM for the financial support of 350 EUR.

\bigskip
\noindent Yours Sincerely,

\bigskip

\noindent Manuel Baumann (President) \hfill Kees Vuik (Faculty Advisor)

\noindent Reinaldo Astidullo (Vice-President) \hfill Martin van Gijzen (Faculty Advisor)

\noindent Thea Vuik (Secretary and Treasurer)
