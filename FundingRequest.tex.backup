 Funding request SIAM Student Chapter Delft
\end{center}

Dear Mr. Van Horssen,

\bigskip
We, three PhD students of the Numerical Analysis section at the TU Delft have recently founded a SIAM Student Chapter at our university. Our Student Chapter is the first division of SIAM in The Netherlands, and it is meant to bring together MSc and PhD students, postdocs and professors from all mathematically-oriented departments. The Chapter organizes seminars, lectures (both on research and on software tools), company visits and social events.

\bigskip
Currently involved departments are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Applied Mathematics (sections Statistics, Mathematical Physics, Numerical Analysis)
 \item Aerospace Engineering (section Aerodynamics)
 \item Electrical Engineering (section Circuits \& Systems and Intelligent Electrical Power Grids)
 \item Marine and Transport Technology (section Offshore \& Dredging Engineering)
 \item Geoscience \& Engineering (section Petroleum engineering)
\end{itemize}
