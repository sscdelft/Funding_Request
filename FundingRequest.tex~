Dear Mr. Van Horssen,

\bigskip
We, three PhD students of the Numerical Analysis section at the TU Delft have recently founded a SIAM Student Chapter at our university. This letter is meant to ask for some funding by our university, in order to become even more succesfull. 

Our Student Chapter is the first and only division of SIAM in The Netherlands, and it is meant to bring together MSc and PhD students, postdocs and professors from all mathematically-oriented departments. The Chapter organizes seminars, lectures (both on research and on software tools), company visits and social events. Our faculty advisors are Martin van Gijzen and Kees Vuik.

\bigskip
Currently involved departments are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Applied Mathematics (sections Statistics, Mathematical Physics, Numerical Analysis);
 \item Aerospace Engineering (section Aerodynamics);
 \item Electrical Engineering (section Circuits \& Systems and Intelligent Electrical Power Grids);
 \item Marine and Transport Technology (section Offshore \& Dredging Engineering);
 \item Geoscience \& Engineering (section Petroleum engineering),
\end{itemize}
and we hope to attract more different departments soon.

\bigskip
SIAM supports our Student Chapter by 500 dollars per year. This money is used to promote the Student Chapter (hanging posters around), and to pay food and drinks during lectures. Furthermore, external speakers will be invited, whose travel we need to pay. In addition, a one-day workshop will be held on February 2, 2015, which will be visited by different PhD students throughout Europe. 

\bigskip
Many succesfull Student Chapters also obtain yearly funding from their own university. In this way, the Student Chapters can reach out to more different departments and invite more people to their talks. Is it possible that our Chapter also obtains some regular funding from the TU Delft?

\bigskip
If you have any further enquiries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

\bigskip
Yours Sincerely,

\bigskip
\
